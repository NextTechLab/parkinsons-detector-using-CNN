# Keras
This just contains a bunch of code I made with different datasets.
I plan to add more code to this repository. Most of the code would be a small 
scale reproductions of different research papers I find interesting or
some existing implementions of AI.

They are just bits of code I have made as I practice and learn working with 
Keras deep learning framework.
