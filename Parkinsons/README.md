This folder contains a a small one dimentional convolutional neural network
with an LSTM layer in the fully connected half of the network.

PS: This was just a shot in the dark. I had no idea if it would work with an
LSTM layer. I did it cause I was curious. It is generally used in image 
captioning and video captioning as well.
